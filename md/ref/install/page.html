    You probably already have <code>make</code> installed.
    For example, OS X and many other POSIX systems come with <code>make</code>, but some versions of Linux do not include it by default and will require you to install it.
    If you're on Ubuntu, you can run <code>sudo apt install make</code> to get it.

<p>You can install Reach by running:</p>
<pre class="snippet unnumbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ curl https://docs.reach.sh/reach -o reach ; chmod +x reach</li></ol></pre>
<p>
  in your project repository.
  You can copy this file to other repositories or move it to a directory in your <code>PATH</code>, like <code>~/bin</code>.
  (<code>PATH</code> is a UNIX environment variable listing each of the directories that contain programs you can run in a shell session.)
