WARNING: Compiler instructed to emit for Algorand, but the conservative analysis found these potential problems:
 * Step 0 (the one starting from the consensus transfer at ./many_txns.rsh:62:5:dot) could have too many assets: could have 16 but limit is 8
 * Step 1 (the one starting from the consensus transfer at ./many_txns.rsh:99:5:dot) could have too many assets: could have 16 but limit is 8
WARNING: Compiler instructed to emit for Algorand, but we can statically determine that this program will not work on Algorand, because:
 * This program could use 1292 units of cost, but the limit is 700; longest path:
     TOP --> preamble --> api --> publish --> l0_publish_lt_1 --> publish0 --> updateState --> apiReturn --> checkSize --> done --> BOT

 * This program could use 18 transactions, but the limit is 16; longest path:
     TOP --> preamble --> publish --> publish1 --> updateState --> checkSize --> done --> BOT
